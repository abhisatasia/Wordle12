//We sought to recreate a fully functional model of the Wordle game to reinforce programming concepts like loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and input validation. The game itself is supposed to challenge the player to guess a five-letter word in six attempts, and feedback is provided in the form of color codes to indicate right letters and positions. Some of the key features include an inbuilt word bank, input validation, replayability, and a strongly defined feedback system. The program has a modular structure, separating game logic, word storage, and user interface for readability and maintainability.
